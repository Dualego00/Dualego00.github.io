excerpt: 'Led the full research pipeline, from problem formulation to model design, experimentation, and paper writing. Proposed the Linear Emotion Space (LES), a novel interpretable framework enabling fine-grained emotion editing across types, intensities, and facial units. Designed LES-Talker with a universal Cross-Dimension Attention Network to align 3D model deformation with emotional control signals, achieving high-quality and controllable talking head generation.'
