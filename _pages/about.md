I am a third-year undergraduate student at Xidian University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology with a specialization in Big Data and Intelligence. I am currently seeking opportunities to pursue a PhD program, where I aim to engage in cutting-edge research in artificial intelligence. During my undergraduate studies, I have conducted research in the fields of deep learning and computer vision. 

My passion lies in fundamental scientific research with the goal of achieving impactful breakthroughs in AI. I aim to first establish advanced foundational frameworks by enhancing structural rigor through mathematical principles and improving interpretability via physical insights. Then, I seek to bridge these advancements to concrete generative outcomes to achieve superior performance.

I have achieved the top academic rank in my major, authored/co-authored several research papers (published or under review), and secured a Kaggle competition championship.
