I am a third-year undergraduate student at Xidian University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology with a specialization in Big Data and Intelligence. I am currently seeking opportunities to pursue a PhD program, where I aim to engage in cutting-edge research in artificial intelligence. 

I have achieved the top academic rank in my major, authored/co-authored several research papers (published or under review), secured a Kaggle competition championship and completed the TOEFL to meet international academic requirements.  

My passion lies in fundamental scientific research in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. I am driven by the desire to experience the pure intellectual joy of research in AI — without rushing into publishing unfinished work or submitting premature results.

Through my past research experiences, I have come to appreciate several valuable perspectives that guide my scientific approach:

(1) Integrating physical insights into network design not only enhances interpretability but also improves final performance;

(2) Exploring adjacent fields often sparks inspiration and provides complementary knowledge that enriches my research;

(3) I remain ever aware of the limits of my own understanding — with an overwhelming number of papers to read and an endless breadth of knowledge to explore, I am humbled and motivated by how much there is still to learn;

(4) The research journey is inherently non-linear — moments of insight are exhilarating, while discrepancies between expectations and outcomes are inevitable. Yet, it is precisely this process that makes scientific inquiry profoundly meaningful.
