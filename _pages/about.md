I am a third-year undergraduate student at Xidian University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology with a specialization in Big Data and Intelligence. I am currently seeking opportunities to pursue a PhD program, where I aim to engage in cutting-edge research in artificial intelligence. 

I have achieved the top academic rank in my major, authored/co-authored several research papers (published or under review), secured a Kaggle competition championship and completed the TOEFL to meet international academic requirements.  

My passion lies in fundamental scientific research in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. I am deeply motivated by the desire to contribute to bridging the gap between human understanding and artificial intelligence. To me, this bridge is akin to the role of deductive reasoning in connecting physical phenomena with mathematical laws â€” a quest for understanding that is both rigorous and profoundly human. Although my major is in computer science, my previous efforts in studying chemistry, physics, and mathematics have given me broader horizons and a more interdisciplinary perspective.

I aspire to help make AI more interpretable and accessible, not only for researchers and practitioners, but also for the broader public. At the same time, this journey is personal: through research, I seek to better understand the relationship between myself and the world. I am drawn to the intellectual purity and depth of AI research, and I value the process of careful, thoughtful inquiry over rushing to publish premature results.
