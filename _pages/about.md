I am a third-year undergraduate student at Xidian University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology with a specialization in Big Data and Intelligence. I am currently seeking opportunities to pursue a Machine Learning PhD program in 2025Fall, where I aim to engage in cutting-edge research in artificial intelligence. 

I have achieved the top academic rank in my major, authored/co-authored several research papers (published or under review), secured a Kaggle competition championship and completed the TOEFL iBT to meet international academic requirements. Additionally, my previous dedicated efforts in studying chemistry (First Prize in the Chinese Chemistry Olympiad) and physics (scored 100 in University Physics) have given me broader horizons and a more interdisciplinary perspective.

My passion lies in fundamental scientific research in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. I am deeply motivated by the desire to contribute to bridging the gap between human understanding and artificial intelligence. To me, this bridge is akin to the role of the reaction mechanism in organic chemistry. Although organic reactions are often accompanied by side products and can be immensely complex—much like the black-box nature of AI model training—the reaction mechanism provides a way to understand and represent how a reaction proceeds, and how it might proceed in the future. It is a process of demystification.

I aspire to help make AI more interpretable and accessible, not only for researchers and practitioners, but also for the broader public. At the same time, this journey is personal: through research, I seek to better understand the relationship between myself and the world. I am drawn to the intellectual purity and depth of AI research, and I value the process of careful, thoughtful inquiry over rushing to publish premature results.
