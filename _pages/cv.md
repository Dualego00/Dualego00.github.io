Education
======
* BEng in Computer Science and Technology, Big Data and Intelligence Track, Xidian University, 2022-2026 (Expected)
  * GPA: 4.0/4.0
  * Rank: 2/1500+ (first year), 1/476 (second year), 1/105 (third year)

Academic Research
======
* LES-Talker: Fine-Grained Emotion Editing in Linear Emotion Space (First Author, Under Review at ICCV 2025)
  * Led the full research pipeline, from problem formulation to model design, experimentation, and paper writing
  * Proposed the Linear Emotion Space (LES), a novel interpretable framework enabling fine-grained emotion editing across types, intensities, and facial units
  * Designed LES-Talker with a universal Cross-Dimension Attention Network to align 3D model deformation with emotional control signals, achieving high-quality and controllable talking head generation

* KAN-Face: Efficient Resource Usage and Precision Lip-Sync (Co-author, Accepted at ICASSP 2025)
  * Contributed to the design and refinement of a lightweight framework utilizing KANs for efficient and accurate talking head generation
  * Participated in the development and review of the Lip-Sync Enhancement Module, which integrates audio-temporal features and 3D representations to improve sync precision
  * Actively involved in technical discussions and rebuttal preparation, focusing on highlighting contributions and addressing reviewer feedback

* EmoSpeaker: Emotion-Controlled Talking Face Generation (Co-author, Under Review at IEEE TMM)
  * Assisted in a one-shot framework capable of fine-grained emotional control and precise lip synchronization
  * Contributed to the design of an audio decoupling mechanism guided by facial attributes
  * Actively involved in paper revision and rebuttal writing, focusing on technical clarity, reviewer responses, and refinement of contributions

Projects Experience
======
* Public Transportation Management System - Android App Development (Team Leader)
  * Led a team in developing a full-stack Android application for public transportation management, utilizing tools such as MySQL, Python, C++, and Qt Creator
  * Designed a low-redundancy relational database tailored to project needs, and implemented a user-friendly visual interface with strong human-computer interaction capabilities
  * Proposed a technical framework for lightweight management systems with similar structures, enabling easy expansion and portability across different use cases

Awards
======
* Champion â€” Task 3 in AAAI2024 Workshop on AI for Digital Human, BDIV Lab
  * Achieved top scores across four evaluation metrics in both video- and audio-based tracks
  * Modified SadTalker by removing PoseNet and redesigning ExpNet for direct 70D 3DMM prediction, enabling strategic trade-offs that improved key directional metrics
  * Enhanced realism via innovative blinking and lip-sync strategies using OpenFace and Hubert, improving non-English alignment and eye movement synthesis

Skills
======
* Developer Tools: Python, Pytorch, C, Assembly Language, MySQL, C++, Java
* Languages: English (TOEFL), Chinese (native tongue)
